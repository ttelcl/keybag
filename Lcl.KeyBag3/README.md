# Lcl.KeyBag3 Library

## Description

This library provides the non-GUI core implementation of the KeyBag3 application.

Keybag3 is a password manager that stores your passwords and other secrets in an
encrypted file. The encryption is done using the AES-GCM algorithm with a
256-bit key. The key is derived from a user-supplied password using the PBKDF2
algorithm with a SHA-256 hash function.
